# hommalinna
Website code behind hommalinna websites.

This project mission is to learn to use django, html, css, javascript and postgres.
Second mission is to learn to make non-static web applications with database.

Hommalinna is my parents cabin in the lapland. Check current websites maded by wordpress of cabin [there](https://www.hommalinna.fi/fi/home/)

Using django and postgres models in the new websites user can write guestbook. Project is not yet ready so new sites are not published yet.

I try to make also easy admin sites where websites content and images can be easily modify.
